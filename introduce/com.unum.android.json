This is our PUBLIC BETA VERSION, meaning - it is a very early version and you may experience bugs/errors. If there are bugs, please email us (team@unum.la) and we'll fix them ASAP. Please know that we are working very hard to bring all the great features we've built to Android! \nSTORY WITH NEW UPDATE:\nTo our unbelievably patient and supportive Android Family <3 Thank you! You seriously don’t know how much it means to us. The positive emails, the helpful tips, and the words of encouragement throughout this process was so appreciated! It was very difficult finding these bugs and bringing in all the new features we built, and we couldn’t have done it without your help. So thank you to each and every one of you from the bottom of our hearts! \nTBH, this is how we feel right now: Imagine you’re sitting on a white sandy beach, right before the sun sets. The soft sand is wedged between your toes. Leaning back - you look off into the horizon and see a faint silhouette. You notice it is drawing closer to you, and then you notice something in its hand. Before the silhouette becomes recognizable, you hear a beautiful melody. It’s Kendrick Lamar’s new HUMBLE song pumping...Haha jk, it’s Journey’s Don’t Stop Believing. \nYou can now make out the figure - it’s the UNUM team, slowly running to you with a bouquet of hand picked dandelions in one hand and a box of chocolates (Non GMO and Vegan of course) in the other. They give you a huge hug, look into your eyes, and say thank you for standing by us. You look up slightly, holding back some tears, and smile. We sit and watch the sunset, together. \nEND STORY.\n**Public Beta Version**\nYou want sleek.\nYou want powerful.\nYou want beautiful.\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nYour design tool for Instagram.
